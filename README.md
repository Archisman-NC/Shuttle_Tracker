# Shuttle Tracker 🚍

A **real-time bus tracking and pick-up notification system** built for NST students.

---

## ✨ Overview
The Shuttle Tracker web-app lets students see the exact location of their college shuttle, request a pick-up with one tap, and display their class schedule to the driver—reducing confusion and unnecessary calls.

### Impact
| Role | Benefits |
|------|----------|
| Students | Shorter waiting times, on-time arrivals |
| Drivers | Fewer calls, clearer routing |
| Faculty | Fewer class disruptions |
| NST Management | More disciplined, data-driven transport system |
